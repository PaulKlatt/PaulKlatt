- ðŸ‘‹ Hey, nice to meet ya.  I'm Paul, and I LOVE board games and video games.  I've spent entire days playing a game of Dungeons and Dragons, Twilight Imperium, 
or Slay the Spire.  I love learning how the different rules and mechanics interact with each other, and how to manipulate them to get the best results.
I've found this same challenge in coding and I'm hoping to pursue this skill as a developer.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently looking into website scraping and AWS while slowly working on a fun little adventure rpg.
